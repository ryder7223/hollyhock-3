## Migrates address

> ⚠️ This is a one-time action that will change all the sdk. Proceed with caution !

If you need to update the SDK with new offsets, run the following:

`python tools/hollyhock.py addresses apply versions/v02.01.7002.0001/addresses.json sdk`

(By replacing the `version/v0X.XX.../addresses.json` by the path to the updated addresses)
